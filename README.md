This is a replacement for Chrome's New Tab Page with something more useful, and sports oriented. Putting sports scores/schedules on the new tab page allows easy access to see current games, as well as which games are worth tuning into (close NBA games are highlighted, NFL games with a team in the red zone are highlighted, etc.).

Lastly, it helps me work on my JavaScript/frontend skills.

I will probably work on this forever, and have unlimited ideas (productivity widgets like Google Calendar). I like it much better than the default New Tab, and like where it is going :)
