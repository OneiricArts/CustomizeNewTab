[Subreddit (forum to communicate easily with me): /r/SportsNewTabPage](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsnewtabpage)

This is a replacement for Chrome's New Tab Page with something more useful, and sports oriented (productivity widgets incoming).

I built this because Chrome's new tab page is lame (and the big Google logo + search bar I never use was probably the last straw). Additionally, sports websites suck, it takes too many clicks for me to see basic stuff. Lastly, it helps me work on my JavaScript/frontend skills.

I will probably work on this forever, and have unlimited ideas. I like it much better than the default New Tab, and like where it is going :)
